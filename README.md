# Agentic-AI

This tutorial is a practical, beginner-friendly guide to understanding and building intelligent agents from the ground up. Whether you're new to agents or looking to solidify your foundational knowledge, this step-by-step walkthrough will help you learn how to design, implement, and enhance autonomous agents using real-world examples.

We’ll explore key concepts such as:

🏗️ How agents work (reactive, rule-based, goal-driven)

🔄 Planning and decision-making logic

💬 Integrating tools like LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, LangChain)

🧩 Adding memory, tool usage, and task decomposition

🚀 Building your own working agent from scratch

Each section includes simple code examples, helpful diagrams, and explanations to guide your learning.
